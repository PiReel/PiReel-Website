Pi Reel is an easy to use animation tool, made for engineers, makers, and scientists of all skill levels. Pi Reel can create everything from animations, entrepreneurial videos, and animated structures and gizmos.  


The Pi Reel Web application is more than a web application. Pi Reel is a school of thought. Our goal is to bring together an inclusive, welcoming group of science enthusiasts and professionals to accomplish through art and science a sustainable, safe, comfortable future for all. 

### Activism  
Monopolization in industries such as the energy industry have led to conflicts like the South Dakota Pipeline Protests, rare earth metal conflicts, and more.

### Our Mission   
We strive every day to bring a tolerant, compassionate, and just world to life by working in the open to collaborate on projects for science, engineering, and creating.  

### Our Beliefs and Values
Our belief is that through art we can overcome obstacles and come together to learn and share our knowledge and dreams.
