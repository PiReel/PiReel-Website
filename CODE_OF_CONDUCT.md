## Our code of conduct

 All participants/volunteers must adhere to the guidelines outlined
 in this document and the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). 
 
Pi Reel, is dedicated to being a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognize that some who choose to participate in the project may be subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we welcome people from all backgrounds and hope to develop a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent. 
Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above causing someone to fear for their safety such as through: 

* stalking
* following
* intimidation 
* the display of sexual or violent images 
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop 
* publication of private communication without consent

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Additionally, given the nature of the project, concerning diverse and sometimes incompatible views, we feel it important to emphasize the importance of civil discussion. Ideas must be discussed without any sort of personal attack or harassment, and while we encourage free expression, it must not be at the expense of others feelings of safety. We recognize that the balance between free expression and an environment that is welcoming to all people at all times is not an easy one, and we will continually work to ensure that EchoBurst is an environment that fosters both acceptance and the free exchange of ideas. 

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the one used by the Software Carpentry Foundation and is a modified version of that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.
